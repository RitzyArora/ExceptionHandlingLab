CafeStar is trying to build a biling system that is bug free so that the billing for their customers will be an easy task.
CafeStar hired some software developers to build that system and also instructed them that if any problem occurs it should display proper message 
not a long error so that it will be easy for the person who will be at counter for billing

bill contains the following :-
quantity, amount, cgst and sgst equal to 2.5% of the amount and grand total
